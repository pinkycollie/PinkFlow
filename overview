# PinkFlow

**Status:** Experimental  
**PersistID:** pinkflow-0001  
**DAOContext:** Pending

## 🌐 Overview
PinkFlow is a process-orchestration layer for partners and collaborators who don’t yet have technical infrastructure.  
It acts as a "fresh coat" system: onboarding them through streamlined pathways, running them through MBTQ.dev’s validation, and giving them clean outputs they can use to integrate back into the ecosystem.  

Think of PinkFlow as a **transitional wrapper** — it makes messy external inputs flow into Deaf-First, standardized, compliant processes.

## ⚙️ Deployment
- **Backend:** To be defined (likely FastAPI or Supabase edge functions)  
- **Infra:** Google Cloud Run / Vercel (review relevance)  
- **DB:** Optional (could rely on Supabase playground for prototyping)  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
