## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

The PinkFlow ecosystem includes multiple components. Depending on what you're working on, you may need:

- **Frontend (React + TypeScript)**:
  - Node.js (v16 or higher)
  - npm or yarn
  
- **Backend (FastAPI)**:
  - Python 3.8+
  - pip
  
- **Real-time Services (Node.js)**:
  - Node.js (v16 or higher)
  - WebSocket support

### Getting Started

1. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/PinkFlow.git
   cd PinkFlow
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment**:
   - For frontend development, navigate to the relevant directory and install dependencies
   - For backend development, set up a virtual environment and install requirements
   - See component-specific README files for detailed setup instructions

3. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make your changes** and test thoroughly

5. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```

## üìù Submission Guidelines

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** to reflect any changes
2. **Follow the PR template** and fill out all sections
3. **Ensure CI checks pass** (automated tests, linting, etc.)
4. **Request review** from maintainers
5. **Address feedback** promptly and respectfully

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat: add new feature`
- `fix: resolve bug in component`
- `docs: update README`
- `style: format code`
- `refactor: restructure module`
- `test: add test coverage`
- `chore: update dependencies`

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and PRs in the body when relevant

## üíª Coding Standards

### General Principles

- Write clear, readable code
