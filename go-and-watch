# API - Go Backend

This directory contains the Go microservice that powers the application's backend.

It provides core functionalities for:
- **PinkSync:** Real-time communication via WebSockets.
- **DeafAuth:** User authentication and identity verification.

## Running Locally

From the monorepo root, run:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
This command starts the Go service in watch mode, automatically recompiling and restarting on file changes
