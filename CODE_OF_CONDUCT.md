# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the PinkFlow community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Deaf-First Values

As part of the MBTQ.dev Deaf-First ecosystem, we additionally commit to:

- **Accessibility**: Ensuring all interactions and contributions are accessible to Deaf and hard-of-hearing community members
- **Visual Communication**: Prioritizing visual, text-based, and asynchronous communication methods
- **Inclusion**: Actively working to include Deaf perspectives in design and decision-making
- **Respect**: Honoring diverse communication preferences and accessibility needs

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being patient with those who are learning
- Providing accessible communication (captions, transcripts, visual aids)

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Making assumptions about someone's abilities based on their disability status
- Dismissing or ignoring accessibility concerns

- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (issues, PRs, discussions, code)
- Communication channels (if/when established)
- Community events (virtual or in-person)
- Public spaces when representing the project

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Reporting

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by:

1. **Creating a private security advisory** on GitHub (for serious violations)
2. **Contacting project maintainers** directly through GitHub
3. **Using the reporting mechanism** in GitHub Discussions (when available)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### What to Include

When reporting, please include:

- Your contact information
- Names (usernames) of people involved
- Description of the behavior
- Links to relevant content (issues, comments, etc.)
- Any additional context that might be helpful

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining consequences:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Accessibility Commitment

We are committed to making our enforcement process accessible:

- All enforcement communications will be available in text format
- We will provide written documentation of decisions
- We will accommodate accessibility needs in the reporting and resolution process
