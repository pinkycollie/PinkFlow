# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

PinkFlow is currently in experimental/development phase. As the project evolves, this section will be updated with information about which versions receive security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Features

PinkFlow is designed with security as a core principle:

### Implemented Security Measures

- **Authentication**: Integration with DeafAuth for secure identity management
- **Trust Validation**: FibonRose trust profile system for contributor validation
- **API Security**: Backend proxy for sensitive API calls (e.g., Gemini API)
- **Environment Variables**: Secure handling of secrets and credentials
- **Code Scanning**: Automated security scanning via GitHub CodeQL (when enabled)
- **Dependency Management**: Automated dependency updates via Dependabot (when enabled)

### Planned Security Features

- OAuth integration for third-party authentication
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Audit logging for critical operations
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please use one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred):
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/pinkycollie/PinkFlow/security)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the advisory form with details

2. **Direct Contact**:
   - Contact the repository maintainers directly through GitHub
   - Use email if contact information is provided

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue (optional)
- **Environment**: Version, configuration, and environment details

### What to Expect

After you submit a report:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We'll assess the severity and impact
3. **Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
4. **Resolution**: We'll work on a fix and coordinate disclosure
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (if you wish)

### Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have time to update

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

If you're contributing to PinkFlow, please follow these security practices:

### Code Security

- **Never commit secrets**: No API keys, passwords, or tokens in code
- **Use environment variables**: For all sensitive configuration
- **Validate input**: Always validate and sanitize user input
- **Escape output**: Prevent XSS by properly escaping output
- **Use parameterized queries**: Prevent SQL injection
- **Follow principle of least privilege**: Request only necessary permissions

### Dependency Security

- **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update to patched versions
- **Review dependencies**: Understand what you're adding to the project
- **Use lock files**: Ensure consistent dependency versions
- **Scan for vulnerabilities**: Use tools like `npm audit` or `pip-audit`

### API Security

- **Backend proxies**: Never expose API keys on the client side
- **Authentication**: Require authentication for sensitive endpoints
- **Authorization**: Verify user permissions before actions
- **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limits to prevent abuse
- **HTTPS only**: Always use HTTPS in production

### Data Security

- **Encrypt sensitive data**: Both in transit and at rest
- **Minimal data collection**: Only collect necessary information
- **Secure storage**: Use secure methods for storing credentials
- **Access control**: Implement proper access controls
- **Data retention**: Have clear policies for data retention and deletion

## Security in the MBTQ.dev Ecosystem

PinkFlow is part of the larger MBTQ.dev ecosystem, which includes:

- **DeafAuth**: Federated identity and authentication service
- **FibonRose**: Trust and ethics validation engine
- **PinkSync**: Real-time collaboration service
- **360Magicians**: AI-driven business agents

Security considerations span the entire ecosystem:

- **Single Sign-On**: Secure authentication across services
- **Trust Scores**: FibonRose validation for contributor actions
- **Data Isolation**: Proper separation between services
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypted service-to-service communication

## Compliance

While specific compliance requirements are still being defined, PinkFlow aims to adhere to:

- **GDPR**: For European users' data protection
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**: For accessibility compliance
- **OWASP Top 10**: Addressing common web vulnerabilities
- **SOC 2**: As the project matures (planned)

## Security Tools and Automation

We use various tools to maintain security:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: For vulnerability reporting and tracking
- **Dependabot**: For automated dependency updates
- **CodeQL**: For static code analysis
- **Secret Scanning**: To detect committed secrets
- **Branch Protection**: To enforce review processes

## Disclosure Policy

When a security issue is fixed:

1. We'll create a security advisory with details
2. We'll notify affected users through appropriate channels
3. We'll publish the advisory publicly after mitigation
4. We'll credit the reporter (unless they prefer anonymity)

## Security Contacts

For security-related questions or concerns:

- Use GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
- Contact repository maintainers through GitHub
